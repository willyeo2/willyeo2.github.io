<p> FEATURING:</p>
<p> LEAD SINGER CASSANDRA STURDIVANT</p>
<p> My name is Cassandra Sturdivant, my principle instrument is alto saxophone. I have been playing for around 9 years. I know just enough piano to accompany, and just a few chords on the guitar. I sing on the side for fun. My main strengths would be in audio engineering and sound design, proficient in the music DAWs included in Berkleeâ€™s software bundle.</p>
