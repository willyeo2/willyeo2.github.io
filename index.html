<h1>Challenegs</h1>
Cassandra Sturdivant:
For the challenes on my end I had a few problems with sizing my picture and rotating the image, luckily I was able to find the code to resolve this issue.
<p> Noah Morris:<p>
<p>I didn't pull the files correctly so i had routing issues within the branches. to fix this i deleted the index.html file and repulled the file from github desktop. This fixed the probelm.<p>
<p>Everyone:<p>
<p> The problems we faced. We had trouble figuring out how to collaberate. After Will sent out the collaberation invites it took a little bit to realize that you had to accept the invite that was locate in the email that is affiliated with github. </p>
